## Description 
This is a to do list. It uses local storage to save your list and your name (which you can change by clicking just after 'Welcome' at the top. This area defaults to 'Type Name Here'). It also categorizes your list items and color codes them based on category. You can edit the items you've added, or delete them completely.
